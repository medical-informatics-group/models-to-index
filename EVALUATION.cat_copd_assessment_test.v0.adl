			purpose = <"To provide a patient-centered assessment tool for quantifying symptom burden and risk for acute exacerbation of COPD, which can also be used to help guide the therapy plan.">
			use = <"To assess the progression of COPD, the functional status, and the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. The assessment is based on eight criteria, each to be scored on a 0-5 numeric scale based on the severity, as such:
- cough: 0 (I never cough) to 5 (I cough all the time)
- pleghm: 0 (I have no phlegm in my chest at all) to 5 (my chest is completely full of phlegm)
- chest tightness: 0 (my chest does not feel tight at all) to 5 (my chest feels very tight)
- breathlessness:  0 (when I walk up a hill or one flight of stairs, I am not breathless) to 5 (when I walk up a hill or one flight of stairs, I am very breathless)
- activities: 0 (I am not limited doing any activities at home) to 5 (I am very limited doing any activities at home)
- confidence: 0 (I am confident leaving my home despite my lung condition) to 5 (I am not at all confident leaving my home because of my lung condition)
- sleep: 0 (I sleep soundly) to 5 (I don't sleep soundly because of my lung condition)
- energy: 0 (I have lots of energy) to 5 (I have no energy at all)

The scores are to be summed into the CAT score, with explanation as following:
- 0-10: low health impact
- 11-20: medium health impact
- 21-30: high health impact
- 31-40: very high health impact.">
