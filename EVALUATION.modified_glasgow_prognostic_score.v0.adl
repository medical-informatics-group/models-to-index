			purpose = <"Provides improved cancer prognosis over the original score, based on serum biomarkers.">
			use = <"Why use:
Multiple studies suggest significantly worse outcome in multiple types of cancer, including “increased weight loss, poor performance status, increased comorbidity, increased pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines and complications on treatment.” (McMillan DC 2013)">
			keywords = <"Cancer", ...>
			misuse = <"The Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) has been evaluated across numerous different cancer cohorts and suggests incrementally worsening prognosis with increasing score.
Depending upon patient selection, stage, cancer and other factors the resulting survival numbers vary widely.
The modified GPS uses the same parameters as the original GPS (CRP and albumin), but weighs the inflammatory component more heavily; i.e., patients with low albumin are still assigned a score of 0 even if CRP is elevated. This modification was shown to have better correlation with survival (in colon and rectal cancer from the original paper, and in other cancers from the validation papers).">
