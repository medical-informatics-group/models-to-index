			use = <"Use the first lab values (ALT and ALP) indicating acute liver injury to calculate the R factor.

FORMULA
R Factor = ( patient’s ALT / upper limit of normal ALT ) / ( patient’s ALP / upper limit of normal ALP )

Note: calculator uses 40 U/L as upper limit of normal ALT and 120 U/L as upper limit of normal ALP. Normal values may vary by lab.

Interpretation:
 R Factor    Injury type              Recommended 1st line tests
