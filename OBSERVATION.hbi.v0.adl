HBI is simpler than the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), which requires symptoms over the past 7 days, however, it is shown to have 93% correlation with the CDAI in the original study (Harvey 1980), a figure that has been duplicated in subsequent studies (Gomes 1986).

Harvey-Bradshaw Index is calculated by adding the selected points:
General well-being*                       0-4p
Abdominal pain*                           0-3p
Number of liquid/soft stools*     1p per stool
Abdominal mass                            0-3p
Complications**                            1p each
*For the previous day, as reported by the patient. 
**Complications are: Artharalgia, uveitis, erythema nodosum, aphtous ulcers, pyoderna gangrenosum, anal fissures, new fistula, abscess


The Harvey-Bradshaw index can be interpreted as:
HBI                           Severity
