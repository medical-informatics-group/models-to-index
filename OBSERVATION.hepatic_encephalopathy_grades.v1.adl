			purpose = <"Using the West Haven Criteria, the Hepatic Encephalopathy Grade provides a method for clinicians to: 
- Classify severity of encephalopathy
- Provide information about a patient's level of consciousness
- Provide information about changes in a patient's  mental state.

">
			use = <"Patients with known cirrhosis and prior hepatic encephalopathy or without known cirrhosis but suspected liver disease and altered mental status.

The 4 grades are listed in the tool issuing a score from 1 to 4. 

The West Haven Criteria are based on the following Signs/symptoms:

- Changes in behavior with minimal change in level of consciousness

- Gross disorientation, drowsiness, possibly asterixis, inappropriate behavior

- Marked confusion, incoherent speech, sleeping most of the time but arousable to vocal stimuli

- Comatose, unresponsive to pain; decorticate or decerebrate posturing

The resultant score is the grading equivalent to that chosen from the list.
