FORMULA
Addition of the selected points: 
Age=1 point for every 5 years
Severity=1 point for every admission NIHSS point
Time delay between symptom onset or last proof of good health and admission= 2 points if >3 hours, 0 points if â‰¤3 hours.
Range of visual fields (new visual field defect)=2 points if yes, 0 points if no.
Glucose at admission= 1 point if >7.3 or <3.7 mmol/L, 0 points if 3.7-7.3 mmol.
Level of consciousness= 3 points if impaired, 0 points if normal.

Always use it together with other information that may not be in the score, and
Use the score only for patients with pre-stroke independence (Modified Rankin Scale 0-2 points). Patients who were already dependent before the stroke will in general remain so after three months.">
