			purpose = <"To record Rapid emergency medicine score (REMS) and subscores, predicting in-hospital mortality in nonsurgical adult patients presenting to the ED.

Calculated with values obtained out of hospital, or in hospital without lab studies.

Helps guide aggressiveness of treatment with parameters routinely acquired in the prehospital setting.">
			use = <"Use for critically ill patients, where in-hospital mortality prediction may help guide treatment modalities.

May not add to clinician gestalt, but can be useful in the prehospital setting for determining whether a patient would benefit from rapid access to advanced life support services.

REMS is superior (Olsson 2004) to the Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) (Rhee 1987) and non-inferior to APACHE II (Olsson 2003).

REMS is calculated as the addition of the selected points:

Variable			Conditon		Points
Age, years		 	<45		0
			45-54		2
			55-64		3
			65-74		5
			>74		6

			130-159		3
			110-129		2
			70-109		0
			50-69		2
			≤49		4

Heart rate, beats per minute	>179		4
			140-179		3
			110-139		2
			70-109		0
			55-69		2
			40-54		3
			≤39		4

Respiratory rate, per minute	>49		4
			35-49		3
			25-34		1
			12-24		0
			10-11		1
			6-9		2

Peripheral oxygen saturation	<75%		4

Glasgow Coma Scale 	<5		4
			5-7		3
			8-10		2
			11-13		1
			>13		0
			

High risk (REMS ≥3): patient may need aggressive treatment.

Low risk (REMS <3): patient may be appropriate to triage for routine treatment (in Olsson 2004, all patients with REMS <3 survived).">

Clinical judgment of a patient’s presentation should always be used to determine need for advanced interventions.
