Variables: 
Localized: Any T; N0; M0
Metastatic: T>0; N>1; M>1
For accurate staging, see the TNM Staging for RCC. 
This score placed patients with local or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) into mortality risk groups: low, intermediate/moderate, and high.

FORMULA:
Addition of the selected points. 

Interpretation: 
Disease Type: Local Disease = Low Risk Group= 91.1% Five-year disease-specific survival
Disease Type: Local Disease = Intermediate Risk Group= 80.4% Five-year disease-specific survival
Disease Type: Local Disease = High Risk Group= 54.7% Five-year disease-specific survival
Disease Type: Metastatic Disease = Low Risk Group= 32% Five-year disease-specific survival
Disease Type: Metastatic Disease = Intermediate Risk Group= 19.5% Five-year disease-specific survival
Disease Type: Metastatic Disease = High Risk Group= 0% Five-year disease-specific survival
