Osteoporosis index of risk (OSIRIS) is a score developed to stratify postmenopausal women patients according their risk of having osteoporosis. Thus the score helps to identify individuals most in need of bone mineral density (BMD) testing.">
			use = <"Use among postmenopausal women to identify individuals most in need of bone mineral density (BMD) testing.
Osteoporosis index of risk (OSIRIS) is a simple questionnaire which helps stratify patients along their risk of having osteoporosis using four variables:
- Age
- Weight [in kg]
- Current Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): 
- Prior low impact fracture: PLIF: -2p if yes, 0 if no
OSIRIS is calculated using the following formula:
OSIRIS: 2*floor(Weight/10) - 2*(Age /10)+cHRT + pLIF

where
- floor(): corresponds to rounding a number toward the smaller integer (i.e. removing any digits after the decimal point)
- cHRT corresponds to the presence of current Hormone replacement therapy and has a value of +2 p if present, and 0 if not.
- pLIF corresponds to the presence if the patient has a history of low impact fracture. In this case 2 p is subtracted from the score (i.e. adding -2p).">
