			use = <"The SCAP Score is used in patients diagnosed with CAP in ED to predict the adverse outcomes which is defined as inpatient mortality, septic shock, and/or need for mechanical ventilation. The SCAP Score is obtained by adding the selected points of all the 8 variables. A cut-off of SCAP Score >= 10 is classified as Severe CAP and recommended for ICU, monitored bed, and/or immediate intervention.
