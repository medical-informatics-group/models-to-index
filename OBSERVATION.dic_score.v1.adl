			purpose = <"To record the lab test results of the coagulation profile; platelet count, prothrombin time, D-dimer level and Fibrinogen.  ">
			use = <"This is used to record the lab test results of  four parameters of the coagulation profile;  platelet count, prothrombin time, D-dimer level and Fibrinogen, which helps to determine the possible overt DIC. DIC is a life threatening condition which develops as a complication of underlying conditions like severe infection, sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric complications etc. 

Each parameter is given a score based on their values and then their sum is taken to get the total score. The total score can help to detect possible overt DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) or non overt DIC. 

This scoring system is applicable only when the patient has been diagnosed with an underlying condition that can predispose to the development of DIC. It is also equally important to repeat the scoring to monitor the development and worsening of DIC in the suspected patients.
