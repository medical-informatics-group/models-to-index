Why Use:
Prevalence of at-risk or heavy alcohol use tends to be higher among adults actively seeking healthcare in the general population.

Most patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal experience uncomplicated AWS and only need supportive care, but up to 20% have complicated AWS (i.e., withdrawal hallucinosis, seizures, delirium tremens), which can result in substantial morbidity and up to 15% mortality if unrecognized. With aggressive prevention and recognition, mortality rates decrease to 1-4% (Schuckit 2014).

PAWSS Scores ≥4 were 93.1% sensitive and 99.5% specific for development of complicated AWS in prospective validation (Maldonado 2015).

Formula for Evaluation:

Each question has a yes or no answer and each no anser has a zero score, while selecting yes adds a one to the total score.

The evaluation will be made based on the total score.

A total score of less than 4 evaluates to Average
While a total score of more than 3 evaluates to a High
