FORMULA
The scores for each of the five NVPS components are summed for a total score of 0-10.

Score interpretation:

Scores ≤2 indicate no pain.
Scores 3-<6 indicate moderate pain.
Scores ≥6 indicate severe pain.
Note: Scores ≥3 indicate possible need for analgesia.

This assessment is normally documented every 4 hours on nursing flow sheets and completed before and after interventions.
