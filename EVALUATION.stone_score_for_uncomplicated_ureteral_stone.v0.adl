STONE Score 0-5= Low Risk group= 9.2% Risk of having ureteral stone= Diagnostic decisions should be based on the other diagnoses being considered.

STONE Score 6-9= Moderate Risk group= 51.3% Risk of having ureteral stone= Ultrasound performed after hydration and demonstrating hydronephrosis would increase the likelihood that this patient's symptoms are being caused by a kidney stone, and may decrease the patient's cumulative radiation exposure.

STONE Score 10-13= High Risk group= 88.6% Risk of having ureteral stone= If clinically improving and low concern for alternative pathology, this patient could initially be managed conservatively without a CT scan. Low-dose CT would be appropriate if stone localization is needed.

Note: Within each group, higher score indicates higher likelihood of a stone.">
