			use = <"Use to record information relevant to the Pack Years Calculator assessment as well as its interpretation. 

Variables: 
- Packs of cigarettes smoked per day (Note: 1 pack = 20 cigarettes.)
- Years the patient has smoked

Interpretation: More pack years correlates with higher lung disease risk, including lung cancer. Consider screening with low-dose CT in patients ≥55 years with ≥30 pack year history. Counsel patients on smoking cessation.
