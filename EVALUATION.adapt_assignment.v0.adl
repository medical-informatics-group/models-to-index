			purpose = <"To record scores calculated by the ADAPT Protocol for Cardiac Event Risk assessesing chest pain patients at 2 hours for risk of cardiac event.">
			use = <"The ADAPT Score and Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol can be used to evaluate patients with chest pain and potentially identify 20% of patients who are low-risk and can be evaluated with a 0-hour and 2-hour troponin test along with EKG and TIMI Risk Scores (for STEMI and UA/NSTEMI).

The ADAPT protocol helps stratifying chest pain patients according to the risk of having major cardiac events. The risk groups are defined as:

Observation		Risk group	Risk of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) in 30 days
Normal troponin, normal EKG and TIMI 0	Low		0-0.3%
Normal troponin, normal EKG and TIMI >0	Intermediate	0.8%
Abnormal troponin or abnormal EKG and any TIMI	High		15.3%">
