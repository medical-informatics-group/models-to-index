			purpose = <"To assess pediatric patients according the severity of airway obstruction with the help of PRAM score using clinical observations.
The Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) provides an objective assessment of asthma exacerbation severity and can predict likelihood of admission or extended ED stay.">
			use = <"PRAM helps to measure severity of airway obstruction in pediatric patients using clinical observations.
The PRAM has been used in pediatric patients 3-17 years old with asthma exacerbations and works best to evaluate improvement of symptoms pre- and post-treatment.

The PRAM does use clinical findings like retractions (which can play a direct role in the decision to admit), and it may over-estimate the score's independent value.

Score can be interpreted as:

Score 0-3: Asthma Severity is Mild
Score 4-7: Asthma Severity is	Moderate
Score 8-12: Asthma Severity is Severe">
