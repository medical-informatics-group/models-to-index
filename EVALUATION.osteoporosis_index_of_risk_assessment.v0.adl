Osteoporosis index of risk (OSIRIS) is a score developed to stratify postmenopausal women patients according their risk of having osteoporosis. Thus the score helps to identify individuals most in need of bone mineral density (BMD) testing.">
			use = <"Use among postmenopausal women to identify individuals most in need of bone mineral density (BMD) testing.
Osteoporosis index of risk (OSIRIS) is a simple questionnaire which helps stratify patients along their risk of having osteroporosis. It stratifies patients into three risk groups:
- Low risk with OSIRIS > 1: only 7% having osteoporosis according to Reginster et al.
- Medium risk with OSIRIS between -3 and 1: 39% having  osteoporosis according to Reginster et al.
- High risk with OSIRIS < -3: 66% having osteoporosis according to Reginster et al.

The recommendations to the risk groups according to Reginster et al. were the following:
- Low risk: postpone  BMD  measurements unless having other medical conditions justifying BMD,
- Intermediate risk: Refer to BMD measurement,
- High risk: initiate  treatment  without  BMD measurement.">
