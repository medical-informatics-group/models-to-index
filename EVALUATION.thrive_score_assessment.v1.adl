			use = <"The Total Health Risk In Vascular Events (THRIVE) score utilises variables such as the NIHSS score, age, and chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation to predict long-term neurologic outcomes in stroke patients. 

Score of 0 :

79-88% chance of a good neurological outcome
0-2% predicted mortality at 90 days.

Score of 9:

7-16% chance of a good neurological outcome
38-58% mortality at 90 days.
