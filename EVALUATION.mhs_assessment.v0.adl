			purpose = <"Marburg heart score rules out coronary artery disease (CAD) in primary care patients with chest pain.">
			use = <"Marburg heart score (MHS) is used with patients ≥35 years old presenting with chest pain in a primary care setting. MHS is a score composed of 5 components. The total score is between 0 and 5.

Variable							Points
Female ≥65 years or male ≥55 years				1
Known CAD, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease	1
Pain worse with exercise					1
Pain not reproducible with palpation				1
Patient assumes pain is cardiac					1


Interpretation:

Score	CAD risk	Recommendation

0-2	3%	Outpatient evaluation as needed
≥3	23%	Consider urgent evaluation or inpatient admission


Consider comparing the result with other CAD guidlines, such as Interchest. There are contradicting opinions, which is considered better, studies show similar NPVs for both guidelines, INTERCHEST has better PPVs but MHS is better studied (see [8] for reference).">
			keywords = <"MHS", "Marburg", "Marburg Heart Score", "CAD", "coronary artery disease", "chest pain", "interchest">
			misuse = <"Not to be used in an emergency setting.

Interchest should not be used in patients with a readily apparent cause of chest pain (e.g. trauma, infection), clear anginal equivalent symptoms (e.g. jaw pain, dyspnea on exertion, arm pain), or if other testing (e.g. electrocardiography, lab testing) has suggested a clearly cardiac etiology.

Not to be used for a positive diagnosis of angina or CAD, but as a negative tool to help assess who is low-enough risk to not need further evaluation.

While scores ≤2 make unstable CAD highly unlikely (NPV 98%), scores ≥3 are only modestly predictive of CAD (PPV 28%).

Most applicable to patients 35 years or older.">
