			purpose = <"To report the physician or care provider's objective assessment of how well the patient is doing despite ongoing rheumatoid arthritis.">
			use = <"Use to record the provider's global assessment of disease activity (PrGDA) using a visual analogue scale (VAS). PrGDA rates the physician's objective assessment of \"how well the patient is doing\" on a VAS between 0.0 = very well (low disease activity) and 10.0 = very poor (high disease activity). The VAS has intervals of 0.5 so that PrGDA can take any of the values: 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 ... 10.0.
PrGDA is a component measure in the calculation of simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI).">
