			purpose = <"To record the PEDIS score and make assessments of the diabetic foot ulcers of the patients who are hospitalized. The diabetic foot ulcers are categorized into low risk and high risk categories based on the PEDIS Score obtained.">
			use = <"Each of the five attributes is given a score varying from 0 to 3 and then the total score (0 – 12) is calculated. Based on this total score, the risk for adverse outcome (a non-healing ulcer, need for amputation or death at 6 months) is determined. The five attributes include, Perfusion, extent, depth, infection and sensation.

The total score ranges from 0 – 12. A score of 
<7 – Low risk for adverse outcome
>=7 – High risk for adverse outcome.
