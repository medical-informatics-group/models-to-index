for post-menopausal women at risk of osteoporosis (consistent with BMD T scores <-2). 
To evaluate osteoporosis risk based on individual factors that are weighted separately in a study based formula.
weighting method in the Osteoporosis risk score calculator:
Age: included in the formula as years
Weight: Included in formulas as Kg
Estrogen:Prior use (0), No prior use (1)
Race: Black (0), Non-Black (5)
Rheumatoid arthritis: Present (4), Absent (0)
Formula to calculate Osteoporosis Risk Score:
Race + Rheumatoid Arthritis + Fracture history + Estrogen + (3 x Age / 10) - (Weight in lbs / 10)">
