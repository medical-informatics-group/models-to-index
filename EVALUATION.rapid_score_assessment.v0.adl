			use = <"This archetype is used to make assessments based on the total score obtained. It consists of five attributes namely, Serum Urea, Age, Purulence of the pleuritic fluid, Infection source and Serum albumin. Each attribute is given points from 0 to 2. 

Risk level assessments:
Total score 0 - 2 - Low risk
                    3 - 4 - Medium risk
                    5 - 7 - High Risk
3 month mortality (%)
Total Score 0 - 2 - 1.5%
                    3 - 4 - 17.8%
                    5 - 7 - 47.8%">
