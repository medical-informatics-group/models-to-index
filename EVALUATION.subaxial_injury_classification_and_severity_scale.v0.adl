The SLICS Score is calculated based on four parameters: Morphology, Discoligamentous complex (DLC) (as seen on x-ray or MRI), Neurological status (by physical exam) and Continuous cord compression (signal change within cord on MRI) in setting of neuro deficit.

Interpretation:

SLICS Score         Recommendation
<4                         Non-operative treatment
4                           Non-operative or operative treatment
≥5                        Operative treatment*

*May consist of realignment, neurological decompression (if indicated), and stabilization.">
