Stage A identifies the patient who is at high risk for developing HF but has no structural disorder of the heart; 

Stage B refers to a patient with a structural disorder of the heart but who has never developed symptoms of HF; 

Stage C denotes the patient with past or current symptoms of HF associated with underlying structural heart disease;

Stage D designates the patient with end-stage disease who requires specialized treatment strategies such as mechanical circulatory support, continuous inotropic infusions, cardiac transplantation, or hospice care.">
