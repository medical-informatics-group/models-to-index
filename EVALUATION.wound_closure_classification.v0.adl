1. Clean wound with minimal tissue loss, e.g. surgical                          Primary
 wounds, clean lacerations.
2. Significant tissue loss precluding tension-free approximation             Secondary
of edges, devitalized edges, ulcerations, or abscess cavities.
3. Grossly contaminated wounds with or without significant tissue          Tertiary (Delayed Primary)
 loss, e.g. contaminated by soil or feces, animal bites, projectiles.">
