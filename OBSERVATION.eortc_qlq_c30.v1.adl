			purpose = <"The  EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) quality  of  life  questionnaire  (QLQ)  is  an  integrated  system  for  assessing  the  health-related quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials.">
			use = <"Version 3.0 is currently the standard version of the QLQ-C30, and should be used for all new
studies unless investigators wish to  maintain compatibility with previous studies, which used an
earlier version of the QLQ-C30.

General principles of scoring
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures.   These include five
functional scales,  three  symptom  scales,  a  global  health  status  /  QoL  scale,  and  six  single  items.
Each of the  multi-item scales includes a  different  set  of items -  no  item occurs  in  more  than  one
scale.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100 and require transformation as described in the scoring procedure (ref. 5)

The principle for scoring these scales is the same in all cases:
1. Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale; this is the
raw score.
2. Use a linear transformation to  standardise the raw score, so  that  scores range from 0 to  100; a
higher  score  represents  a  higher  (\"better\")  level  of  functioning,  or  a  higher  (\"worse\")  level  of
symptoms.
