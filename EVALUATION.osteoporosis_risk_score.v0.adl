for post-menopausal women at risk of osteoporosis (consistent with BMD T scores <-2). 
To evaluate osteoporosis risk based on individual factors that are weighted separately in a study based formula.

The three risk categories for likelihood of developing osteoporosis are:

 Low: scores of 6 and below;

Moderate: scores between 7 and 15;

High: scores of 16 and above.">
