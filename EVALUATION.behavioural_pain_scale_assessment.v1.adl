			purpose = <"The process of intubation can be very painful for some patients and being aware of this pain is important to handle such patients appropriately especially as there is no way for them to verbally communicate this during the intubation process. The BPS tool utilises patient body language clues and ventilator-patient interactions to assess whether they are experiencing pain during intubation.">
			use = <"The assessed pain severity is divided into 4 categories: no, mild, unacceptable and maximum pain.

Score interpretation:

    Scores ≤3 = no pain.
    Scores 4-5 = mild pain.
    Scores 6-11 = unacceptable amount of pain.*
    Scores ≥12 = maximum pain.*

*For scores ≥6 sedation and/or analgesia should be considered.">

			misuse = <"Wherever possible, supplimentary evidence to support or refute this assessment should be found by using quantitative tools and checking vital signs changes in ICU as careful clinical observation and examination is required to accurately assess the patient.">
