			use = <"CEDOCS Score = –29.53 + (3.14 x critical care patients in the ED) + (0.52 x waiting time of longest admitted patient) + (1.14 x number of patients in waiting room) + (20.55 x ratio of total ED patients to number of ED beds) + (0.00124 x ED visits per year) + A + B + C + D (additional variables based on ED visits per year) as follows:

Threshold                                                   Additional variables*
If ED visits per year ≥18,811                         A = – [(1.09 x 10-12) x (ED visits per year – 18,811)3]
If ED visits per year ≥43,012                         B = [(8.18 x 10-12) x (ED visits per year – 43,012)3]
If ED visits per year ≥49,466                         C = – [(8.18 x 10-12) x (ED visits per year – 49,466)3]
If ED visits per year ≥67,273                         D = [(1.08 x 10-12) x (ED visits per year – 67,273)3]

*Include all variables in scoring where “ED visits per year” is greater than or equal to the threshold. If “ED visits per year” does not meet the threshold requirement, count variable as 0. For example, if ED visits per year is ≥43,012, final CEDOCS Score = CEDOCS Score + A + B. 
Note: Final CEDOCS Score is multiplied by the scaling factor specified. If no scaling factor or a scaling factor of 0 is specified, final CEDOCS Score is multplied by 2.

Score interpretation:
Level:          Score:            Interpretation:
Level 1        1-20               Not busy
Level 2        21-60             Busy
Level 3        61-100           Extremely busy but not overcrowded
Level 4       101-140          Overcrowded
Level 5       141-180          Severely overcrowded
Level 6       181-200          Dangerously overcrowded">
