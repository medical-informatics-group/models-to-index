Interpretation of SMART-COP Score

SMART-COP Score               Risk Group                Risk for IRVS
            0-2                                 Low                           Minimal
            3-4                                Moderate                    1 in 8
            5-6                                 High                           1 in 3
                                     Consider ICU admission                       
           >=7                             Very High                      2 in 3
