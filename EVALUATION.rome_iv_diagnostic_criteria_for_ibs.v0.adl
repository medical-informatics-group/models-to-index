			purpose = <"To provide diagnostic criteria dan evaluation of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).">
			use = <"As an evaluation tool for patient suspected of IBS. 
In order to fulfill the diagnostic criteria, the patient must have a predominant symptom of reccurent abdominal pain at least one day per week in the last 3 months which the onset occured since 6 months before diagnosis. The abdominal pain must be accompanied with at least two of the following criteria:
- related to defecation (either increased or decreased pain),
- associated with a change in stool frequency,
- associated with a change in stool form (appearance).

To further define the subtypes, additional evaluation of the stool form should be performed and intrepreted as such:
- Constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C): more than one quarter (25%) of stools have Bristol stool form type 1 or 2, and less than a quarter, stool form 6 or 7.
- Diarrhoea predominant IBS (IBS-D): more than one quarter (25%) of stools have Bristol stoolformtype 6 or 7, and less than a quarter, stool form 1 or 2.
- IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M): more than one quarter (25%) of stools have Bristol stool form type 1 or 2 and more than a quarter, stool form 6 or 7.
- Non-classified IBS (IBS-U): IBS patients whose bowel habits cannot be classified in any of the above three categories.">
