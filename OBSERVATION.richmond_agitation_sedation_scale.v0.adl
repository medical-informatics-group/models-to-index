			use = <"The RASS can be used in all hospitalized patients to describe their level of alertness or agitation. It is however mostly used in mechanically ventilated patients in order to avoid over and under-sedation.

Mechanically ventilated that are deeply sedated (RASS of -3 or less) have been shown to remain intubated and mechanically ventilated for longer periods of time. This in turn leads to longer ICU stays and higher mortality.
Similarly, mechanically ventilated patients that are too agitated are at risk of self-extubation and of ventilator dyssynchrony.

As opposed to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the RASS is not limited to patients with intracranial processes.

An observation is scaled on the below definition points:

Criteria	Definition	Points

Combative                                 +4
Very agitated	               +3
Agitated		               +2
Restless		               +1
Alert and calm	                0
Drowsy	Not fully alert          -1
Light sedation	               -2
Moderate sedation	               -3
Deep sedation	               -4
Unarousable
