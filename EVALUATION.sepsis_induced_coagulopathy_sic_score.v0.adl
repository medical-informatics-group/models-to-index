SIC Score            Approximate 28-day mortality

IMPORTANT
Launched during COVID-19 crisis. COVID-19 Resource Center. The SIC Score has been evaluated in the COVID-19 crisis given concerns that COVID-19 may cause thrombosis, but this has only been evaluated in one study in China for now.

\"Total SOFA\" is the summation of the SOFA Score's Respiratory, Cardiovascular, Hepatic, and Renal SOFA components.">
