			use = <"TASH score is used to predict when to initiate the massive transfusion protocol for a severely injured patient with massive hemorrhage. It is based on 8 attributes which includes both clinical assessment and laboratory tests.
Massive transfusion protocols are institution-specific, but often are 1:1:1 or 1:1:2 for fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and packed red blood cells
