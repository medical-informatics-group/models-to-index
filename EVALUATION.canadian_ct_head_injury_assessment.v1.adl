			use = <"The score uses 2 separate parts. If any of the variables in the first part are scored positively, the risk is automatically high and CT is recommended. If none of the variables in the first part are positively scored, the scores in the 2nd part are considered. If any score positively here, the  risk is then set at medium.

The 5 variables in the first part include:

Age, evidence of skull fractures (0pen, depressed or basliar), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and episodes of vomiting. As each question in this section indciates a high risk of serious head injury, if any are answered positively, a CT should be performed.

The 2 variables in the Medium risk category are:

Evidence of retrograde amnesia and a \"dangerous mechanism\" (see questions).
If any of these questions are answered positively, consider performing a CT scan due to the medium risk.

If neither part is scored positively, a CT is unnecessary.
