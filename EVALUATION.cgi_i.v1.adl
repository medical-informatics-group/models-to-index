			purpose = <"The CGI scores are actually a pair of one-item measures that evaluate the (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and (b) any improvements of treatment also on a 7 point scale (CGI-I) - (which is this scale)

As a quick assessment before a more indepth clinical assessment, the CGI scores can be filled in in under a minute by a clinician/expert rater and is easy to understand and use. It has longitudinal sensitivity over time and compares well with other more complex/time-consuming tools.">
			use = <"The CGI-I can be used at each occasion after medication has been started so that the clinician can compare the patient's condtion with the week prior. Using the CGI-S score as a base-value often assists in this comparison.

The CGI-I poses the following question: \"Compared to the patient’s
condition at admission to the project [prior to medication initiation], this patient’s condition is one of the following: 

1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment
2=much improved
3=minimally improved
4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment)
5=minimally worse 
6= much worse 
7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.
