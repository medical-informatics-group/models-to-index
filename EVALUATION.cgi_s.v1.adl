			purpose = <"The CGI scores are actually a pair of one-item measures that evaluate the (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 (which is this scale) and (b) any improvements of treatment also on a 7 point scale (CGI-I). 

As a quick assessment before a more indepth clinical assessment, the CGI scores can be filled in in under a minute by a clinician/expert rater and is easy to understand and use. It has longitudinal sensitivity over time and compares well with other more complex/time-consuming tools.
">
			use = <"The CGI can be applied across all psychiatric disease states and medications and assists in tracking progress for the purposes of due diligence and reporting to third parties over a shorter time period.

The CGI-S poses the following question: \"Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?” The time period is 7 days and the clinician assesses overall severity across that time period. The rating is solely based on the clinician's clinical judgement.

This is rated on a seven-point scale: 

1=normal, not at all ill
2=borderline mentally ill
3=mildly ill
4=moderately ill
5=markedly ill
6=severely ill
7=among the most extremely ill patients.
