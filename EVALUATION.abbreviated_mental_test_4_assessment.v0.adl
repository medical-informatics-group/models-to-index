It is easy to use and yields a simple dichotomous outcome.
The full AMT (AMT-9) has been shown to be infrequently and incorrectly used in practice. The AMT-4 has been shown to have statistically significant close correlation with the full AMT score throughout its range of values


Four question is asked from the patient. Each question score 1 if the patient answers correctly, 0 if not. In total, 4 points can be given.  The questions are:
-Today's year
-Patient's age
-Date of birth
-Place


Score interpretation:
