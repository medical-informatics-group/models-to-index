Westley Croup Score mainly used for research, not clinically. 
Westley Croup Score variables and assigned points: 
1. Chest wall retractions: None=0, Mild=1, Moderate=2, Severe=3
2. Stridor: None=0, With agitation=1, At rest=2
3. Cyanosis: None=0, With agitation=4, At rest=5
4. Level of consciousness: Normal=0, Disoriented=5
5. Air entry: Normal=0, Decreased=1, Markedly decreased=2

Westley Croup Score formula: 
5 items using a Likert-type scale with zero representing the normal state. Points assigned as above.

Westley Croup Score and Level of Severity: 
score 0-2= Mild
score 3-5= Moderate
score 6-11= Severe
score 12-17= Impending Respiratory Failure

Note: Remember that the Westley Croup Score is typically used for research purposes; management is typically based on clinical signs and symptoms: (1) Consider bacterial tracheitis in an ill-appearing child with croup-like symptoms. (2) The vast majority (>80%) of children presenting to the ED with croup have mild disease; severe croup is rare (<1%).
