			use = <"To interpret the OST score which is calculated using the age and weight of the patient.

Formula: 

OST Score = 0.2*(Weight(Kg) – Age(years))

Interpretation of OST Score:

OST Score                       Risk Group
< -3                                    High-Risk
-3 – 1                                 Moderate-Risk
