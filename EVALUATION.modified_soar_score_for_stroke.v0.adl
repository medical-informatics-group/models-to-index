			use = <"Patients admitted with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke that have mRS and NIH Stroke Scale assessments.

Can be applied for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
Component variables are familiar to most clinicians.
Can be calculated quickly.
Does not necessitate a weighting algorithm.
Can be administered by non-MD personnel.
Component variables are static over a given hospitalization.

mSOAR can be calculated by adding of the selected points:
		0 points	1 point		2 points
Stroke type		Infarct		Hemorrhage	--
Oxford Community Stroke Project classification	LACS/PACS	POCS		TACS
Age (years)		≤65		66–85		>85
Pre-stroke disability (Modified Rankin Score)	0–2		3–4		5
NIH Stroke Scale Score		0–4		5–10		≥11

LACS, lacunar circulation stroke. PACS, partial anterior circulation stroke. POCS, posterior circulation stroke. TACS, total anterior circulation stroke.
