			purpose = <"To provide interpretation of the outcome prediction in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.">
			use = <"Glasgow Alcoholic score is calculated by the addition of the following points:
- age : <50 yrs: 1p, ≥50 yrs: 2p
- white blood cell counts: <15*10^9: 1p, ≥15*10^9: 2p
- urea level: <5 mmol/L: 1p, ≥5 mmol/L: 2p
- PT ratio: < 1.5: 1p, 1.5-2: 2p, >2: 3p
- bilirubin: <125 μmol/L: 1p, 125-250 μmol/L: 2p, >250 μmol/L: 3p
The Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score ranges  from 5 to 12 as the minimum and maximum score, respectively.
The assessment is to be performed on day 1 of admission and day 6-9.

Scores of less than 9 show a much better 28- and 84-day survival than scores above 9 or above (87%/79% vs. 46%/40%). The score is less sensitive but more accurate than the Modified Discriminant Function or MELD scores.">
