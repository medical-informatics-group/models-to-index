			purpose = <"This archetype holds data for chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages, using GFR and ACR categories based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Chronic Kidney Disease Work Group.">
			use = <"Use to store data about an individual's chronic kidney disease (CKD) status. CKD can be classified to 1 of 18 possible stages based on KDIGO GFR and ACR categories.
The KDIGO-CKD classification takes the form of any combination of GFR category (G1, G2, G3a, G3b, G4, G5) and ACR category (A1, A2, A3), so that the least severe stage of CKD is classified as G1A1 and the most severe is classified as G5A3.
This classification is useful for staging and evaluating CKD, for predicting the progression and prognosis of CKD (risk of adverse outcome), and for determining the frequency of monitoring (number of times per year) of GFR and ACR in individuals with CKD. 
Increased ACR (higher ACR category) and decreased GFR (higher GFR category) are individually, and in combination, associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes and increased frequency of monitoring.

Low risk:   G1A1, G2A1.
Moderately increased risk:   G1A2, G2A2, G3aA1.
High risk:   G1A3, G2A3, G3aA2, G3bA1.
Very high risk:   G3aA3, G3bA2, G3bA3, G4A1, G4A2, G4A3, G5A1, G5A2, G5A3.

Monitor one (1) time annually:	G1A1, G1A2, G2A1, G2A2, G3aA1.
Monitor two (2) times annually:   G1A3, G2A3, G3aA2, G3bA1.
Monitor three (3) times annually:   G3aA3, G3bA2, G3bA3, G4A1, G4A2.
Monitor four (4) or more times annually:   G4A3, G5A1, G5A2, G5A3.">
