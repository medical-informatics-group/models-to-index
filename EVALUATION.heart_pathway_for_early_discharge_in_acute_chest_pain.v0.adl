Interpretation:
HEART Score ≤3, Initial troponin 0 point= Low Risk (0.9-1.7% 30-day MACE) and Recommendation is to repeat troponin at 3 hours and if negative, discharge home with outpatient follow-up.
HEART Score ≤3, Initial troponin 1-2 points= High Risk (12-65% 30-day MACE) and Recommendation is Cardiology consultation and admission recommended. Further testing indicated.
HEART Score ≥4, Initial troponin 0 point= High Risk (12-65% 30-day MACE) and Recommendation is to Admit to hospital or observation. Further testing indicated.
HEART Score ≥4, Initial troponin 1-2 points= High Risk (12-65% 30-day MACE) and Recommendation is Cardiology consultation and admission recommended. Further testing indicated.
