In order to fulfill the diagnostic criteria, the patient must have at least 2 of following symptoms which persisted for ≥3 months with the onset of ≥6 months ago. Several symptoms are assesed on the frequency of occurence in at least 25% of defecations, which are:
- straining, 
- lumpy or hard stools, 
- sensation of inclomplete evacuation, 
- sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage, 
- and the need of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation, such as digital evacuation or pelvic floor support.
Another symptom, less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week, is assessed regardless of its frequency of occurence.

The other two separated criteria are both mandatory for the fulfillment of a functional constipation diagnosis:
- loose stools rarely present without use of laxatives
- the patient does not meet Rome IV criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)">
