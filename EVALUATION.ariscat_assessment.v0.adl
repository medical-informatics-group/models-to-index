		Yes			17
Preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL)	No			0

The scores can be interpreted as:
ARISCAT Score	Risk group	Risk of in-hospital postoperative pulmonary complications*
<26	Low		1.6%
26–44	Intermediate	13.3%
≥45	High	42.1%

*Complications were defined as a composite including respiratory failure, respiratory infection, pleural effusion, atelectasis on chest x-ray, pneumothorax, bronchospasm treated with bronchodilators, and aspiration pneumonitis.">
