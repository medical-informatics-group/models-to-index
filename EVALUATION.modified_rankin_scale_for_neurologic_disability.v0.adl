			use = <"The mRS can help users determine the degree of disability in patients who have suffered a stroke. The mRS is a widely used measure to assess the functional outcomes for patients who have suffered a stroke. It can also provide a common language for describing the degree of disability.

The mRs can be determined by asking the following Yes/No Questions:
- Do you have any symptoms that are bothering you?
- Are you able to do the same work as before?
- Are you able to keep up with your hobbies?
- Have you maintained your ties to friends and family?
- Do you need help making a simple meal, doing household chores, or balancing a checkbook?
- Do you need help with shopping or traveling close to home?
- Do you need another person to help you walk?
- Do you need help with eating, going to the toilet, or bathing?
- Do you stay in bed most of the day and need constant nursing care?">

			misuse = <"The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) assesses disability in patients who have suffered a stroke and is compared over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability. A score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs; 6 is death.

The mRS has been used in clinical research for over 30 years and is a common standard for assessing functional outcomes in patients with stroke.
Multiple studies have shown that the mRS correlates with physiological indicators such as stroke type, lesion size and neurological impairment as assessed by other stroke evaluation scales.
Points to keep in mind:

There is criticism that the mRS contains subject components that results in variability and bias that lowers the score’s reliability.
The use of structured interviews when assessing the mRS appears to result in improved interrater reliability though this effect is not completely consistent.
