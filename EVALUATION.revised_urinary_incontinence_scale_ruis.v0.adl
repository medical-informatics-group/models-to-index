Revised Urinary Incontinence Scale (RUIS): Scoring Guide
Consider the last 4 weeks. Do you experience and, if so, how much are you bothered by:
1. Urine leakage related to the feeling of urgency
Not at all 0
Slightly 1
Moderately 2
Greatly 3
2. Urine leakage related to physical activity, coughing or sneezing
Not at all 0
Slightly 1
Moderately 2
Greatly 3
3. Small amounts of urine leakage (drops)
Not at all 0
Slightly 1
Moderately 2
Greatly 3
4. How often do you experience urine leakage?
Never 0
Less than once a month 1
A few times a month 2
A few times a week 3
Every day and/or night 4
5. How much urine do you lose each time?
None 0
Drops 1
Small splashes 2
More 3
The RUIS total score is calculated by adding a person’s score for each question. Adding the score
for the five questions results in a possible score range from 0 – 16.

The RUIS score distributions, clinician and patient severity ratings and other indicators of severity
were examined to provide the following RUIS score ranges as an aide to interpretation:
percentile of the
clinical sample.
0-3: no urinary incontinence or extremely mild (‘slight’) or occasional (‘rare’) incontinence
4-8: mild urinary incontinence
9-12: moderate urinary incontinence
13-16: severe urinary incontinence (scores of 15 – 16 could be considered very severe).
