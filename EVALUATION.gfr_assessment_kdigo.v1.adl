			use = <"Use to store data about an individual's glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR values can be assigned to 1 of 6 possible KDIGO-GFR categories.

KDIGO G1 is normal to high GFR (more than 90 ml/min/1.73m2), 
KDIGO G2 is mildly decreased GFR (60 - 89 ml/min/1.73m2), 
KDIGO G3a is mildly to moderately decreased GFR (45 - 59 ml/min/1.73m2), 
KDIGO G3b is moderately to severely decreased GFR (30 - 44 ml/min/1.73m2), 
KDIGO G4 is severely decreased GFR (15 - 29 ml/min/1.73m2), and 
KDIGO G5 is kidney failure (less than 15 ml/min/1.73m2).

May be used in concert with ACR assessment archetype (openEHR-EHR-EVALUATION.acr_assessment_kdigo.v1) to stage and evaluate the risk of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).">
