			purpose = <"The SAS can be applied to any patient who is postop from major surgery.The SAS can often predict the risk of complication more objectively than clinician gestalt; in one study, it correlated well with admission to an ICU setting (when not initially admitted to an intensive care setting).">
			use = <"A score based on blood loss, heart rate, and blood pressure.
The SAS can be applied to any patient who is postop from major surgery.
FORMULA
Addition of the selected points; points assigned below:
FACTS 
Score interpretation:
Score 0- 2: Very high risk patient of poor outcome. 14% mortality rate, overall 75% risk of major complication including death. In one follow-up study, patients with scores ≤4 were 97% specific for post-operative ICU admission if not initially admitted there.


Score 3-4: Very high risk patient of poor outcome. 14% mortality rate, overall 56% risk of major complication including death. In one follow-up study, patients with scores ≤4 were 97% specific for post-operative ICU admission if not initially admitted there.


Score 5-6: High risk patient of poor outcome. 4% mortality rate, overall 16% risk of major complication including death.

Score 7-8: Moderate risk patient of poor outcome. 1% mortality rate, overall 6% risk of major complication including death.


Score 9-10:Low risk patient of poor outcome. 0% mortality rate, overall <4% risk of major complication including death.
