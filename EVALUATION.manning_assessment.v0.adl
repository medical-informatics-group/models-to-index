			purpose = <"Determining the likelihood of irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis based on clinically significant criteria.">
			use = <"The Manning Criteria were developed to help predict which patients will de diagnosed with IBS, i.e. will not have any organic disease identified after complete work-up. In a setting where work-up resources are limited, or take undue time, these may be particularly useful.

IBS is a ‘rule-out’ diagnosis, which is to say all other possibilities must be ruled out first.

The Manning Criteria is the addition of positive criterion:
- Onset of pain linked to more frequent bowel movements
- Looser stools associated with onset of pain
- Pain relieved by passage of stool
- Noticeable abdominal bloating
- Sensation of incomplete evacuation more than 25% of the time
- Diarrhea with mucus more than 25% of the time

If no red flag signs are present, a patient likely has IBS when at least 3 of the 6 criteria are met with 63-90% sensitivity and 70-93% specificity.">
