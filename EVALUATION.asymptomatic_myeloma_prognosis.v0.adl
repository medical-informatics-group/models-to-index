			purpose = <"Provides prognostic information for patients.

Suggests patients who may need closer follow up.

Allows for stratification of patients on clinical trials potentially evaluating newer, targeted myeloma therapies.

Does not require FISH studies, cytogenetic, or MRI bone studies, which may add further discrimination but are not widely available; hence, generalizability is preserved in settings with limited availability of these studies">
			use = <"Used to store the evaluated risk level from the Asymptomatic Myleoma Prognosis according to:

High risk
BM plasmacytosis ≥10% AND

Intermediate risk
BM plasmacytosis ≥10% AND
Serum monoclonal protein <3 g/dL
