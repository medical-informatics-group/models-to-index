			purpose = <"To assess asthma severity among children using the Pediatric asthma score (PAS)">
			use = <"PAS can be used in children aged 2-18 years with asthma exacerbation to guide inpatient medical management.  
Can also be applied in the emergency department.
PAS is helpful in patients unwilling or unable to comply with peak expiratory flow measurement.
May quantify severity of asthma, but cannot predict response to treatment prior to intervention.
Good inter-observer agreement among physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists in an ED setting.
Developed based on published guidelines of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program in an effort to improve outcomes.

PAS is calculated by adding up points given for 5 criteria (all ranging between 1 and 3): Respiratory Rate by Age, Oxygen Requirements, Auscultation, Retractions, Dyspnea

PAS ranges between 5 and 15, and can be interpreted as:
PAS	Severity of Exacerbation	Percent of Peak Flow (Personal Best or Predicted)
5-7	Mild	>70%
8-11	Moderate	50-70%
12-15	Severe	<50%">
